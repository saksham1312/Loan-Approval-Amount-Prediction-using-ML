# Loan-Approval-Amount-Prediction-using-ML
# Loan Approval Prediction System

A machine learning project that predicts both loan approval status and suitable loan amounts for applicants.

## 📊 Project Overview
This project implements a dual-task machine learning system:
- **Classification**: Predicts loan approval (Approved/Rejected)
- **Regression**: Predicts optimal loan amount for approved applications

## 🚀 Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Logistic Regression for classification
- Linear Regression for amount prediction
- Model evaluation and visualization

## 📈 Results
- **Loan Approval Accuracy**: [91.92]%
- **Loan Amount Prediction R² Score**: [0.85
- Key influential features: CIBIL score, income, and asset values

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab
- Machine Learning
